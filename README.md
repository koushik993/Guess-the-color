# Guess-the-color

This is a simple game to guess the color from the provided color palette. The user is prompted to guess a color. If the color does not match the color pallette, the computer provides a hint about the color and asks the user to try again. 
Once the user guesses the right color, the page's background changes to that color and a message is displayed with the number of guesses.
